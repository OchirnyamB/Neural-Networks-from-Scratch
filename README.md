# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch
Building basic neural network from scratch with Python

## Requirements
* python3
* numpy V1.18.2
* matplotlib V3.2.1
* nnfs latestV

### The Goal of Machine Learning?
> Computers should be able to learn from the experience of the problem they are trying to solve.

### What is Artificial Neural Network?
> It is a computational system consisting of graph structure with connection weights and biases that are modifiable using a learning algorithm while
> attempting to mimic the neural connections in our nervous system.
