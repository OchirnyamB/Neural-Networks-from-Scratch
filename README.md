# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch
Building basic neural network from scratch with Python

### Requirements
* python3
* numpy V1.18.2
* matplotlib V3.2.1
* nnfs latestV

### The Goal of Machine Learning?
> Computers should be able to learn from the experience of the problem they are trying to solve.

### What is Artificial Neural Network (ANN)?
> It is a computational system consisting of graph structure with connection weights and biases that are modifiable using a learning algorithm while
> attempting to mimic the neural connections in our nervous system.

### What is the most important algorithm in NN history?
**Backpropagation** can be considered the cornerstone of modern NNs and deep learning.
1. The _forward pass_ where our inputs are passed through the network and output predictions obtained (also known as the propagation phase)
2. The _backward pass_ where we compute the gradient of the loss function at the final layer of the network and use this gradient to recursively apply the chain rule to update the weights in our network.
